The entry point for your Interpreter implementation is in `app/main.py`.

Study and uncomment the relevant code: 

```python
# Uncomment this block to pass the first stage
if file_contents:
    raise NotImplementedError("Scanner not implemented")
else:
    # Placeholder, remove this line when implementing the scanner
    print("EOF  null")
```

Push your changes to pass the first stage:

```
git add .
git commit -m "pass 1st stage" # any msg
git push origin master
```
